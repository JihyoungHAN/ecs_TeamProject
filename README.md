UC Davis Summer Session 2 ECS 170 Introduciton to Artificial Intelligence Team Project 

## Project Name
Traffic light Classificiation Website 

## Explanation of Project 
For the blind people, this website could classify the traffic light color. To classify the traffic light, YOLO algorithm is used. Then Image Processing using Open CV, it could recognize the traffic light color. The significance of this application lies in its potential to provide invaluable assistance in the daily lives of those with color blindness. Whether navigating pedestrian crossings or driving, individuals with color blindness can rely on the application to accurately identify traffic light colors on their behalf. This not only empowers them to drive without limitations but also contributes to a reduction in accident rates.
